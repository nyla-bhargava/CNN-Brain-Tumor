# Brain Tumor Classification Using CNN

## 📌 Themes Covered

This project focuses on improving post-pandemic healthcare systems, supporting medical professionals, and enhancing patient outcomes with AI-powered diagnostic tools. The system uses a highly trained deep learning model to detect brain tumors from MRI scans with high precision.

The goal of this project is to:
- Support radiologists with AI-assisted MRI interpretation  
- Reduce diagnostic delays  
- Improve accessibility of medical diagnostics  
- Provide a foundation for future AI-assisted clinical tools

## ❗ Problem Statement

Brain tumor diagnosis requires skilled radiologists, and delays in interpretation can significantly affect patient health. In many regions:
- MRI scans are not interpreted quickly  
- Misdiagnosis or late diagnosis reduces survival rates  
- Radiologists face significant workload pressure  

Studies show that **over 250,000+ brain tumor cases** occur yearly worldwide, and early detection greatly improves recovery.

To address this, we designed an AI system that automatically detects and classifies brain tumors from MRI scans with high accuracy.

## 🚀 Introduction

**BrainTumor AI** is an intelligent system that allows users to upload MRI scans and get instant predictions of four major tumor types:

- Glioma  
- Meningioma  
- Pituitary Tumor  
- No Tumor  

### Key Features:
✔ Instant MRI classification  
✔ Clean and intuitive UI (web)  
✔ High-accuracy deep learning model  
✔ Real-time prediction response  

This system helps medical professionals, students, and low-resource hospitals by providing accessible AI diagnostic support.

### Real-World Applications:
- Assist radiologists with a second opinion  
- Help rural clinics with limited specialists  
- Educational tool for medical students  
- Fast screening in large datasets
